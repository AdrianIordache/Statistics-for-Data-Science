# Statistics for Data Science

### Exploring statistical concepts for Time Series:
(Based on predicting the stock price of Bitcoin)
- [x] Trend, Seasonality, Residuals
- [x] (Partial) Autocorrelation
- [x] Stationarity & ADF Test
- [x] AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMAX models. 
- [x] Standardized residuals analysis
 
### And also post-hoc statistical analysis methods: 
- [x] ANOVA
- [x] Hypothesis testing
- [x] Linear regression.

### 4. Predicting the price of Bitcoin
**Unfortunately for the Bitcoin owners, my model's predictions were not that accurate...**

**... but neither were the predictions of [JP Morgan](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/jp-morgan-predicts-long-term-bitcoin-price-may-reach-150000-12452972.htm) :)**
